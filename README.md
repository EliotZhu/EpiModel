Abstract: This is the first worldwide population-based study that estimates the daily effective reproduction number of 
SARS-CoV-2 across countries and over time as various public health interventions were adopted. 
This allowed us to look at the evolution of disease transmission in the presence of containment measures. 
Our results highlight the importance of using real-time estimates of the effective reproduction number as an 
early signal of the efficacy of containment measures, since we found that the peak in reported cases lags 
considerably behind that of the reproduction number, and that future predictions were sensitive to the currency 
of model parameters. We found that heterogeneity of the impact of social distancing on transmission rates across 
countries could not be explained solely by the timing and number of adopted interventions, implying that 
implementation of and response to these policies may have an important role. Finally, we were able to predict with 
reasonable accuracy which countries would experience outbreaks in the next 30 days.
